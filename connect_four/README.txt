Connect Four

This program uses the pygame library to create a connect four game. The object
of this game is very self-explanatory, connect four of the same color pieces.
These can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. The arrow keys are used to
select the column in which the piece is to be dropped, and the space bar is
used to actually drop the piece. One a player connects four pieces the winner
is displayed and at this point any key can be pressed to continue. There is a
scoreboard in the top right corner that is kept up to date as long as the game
is open.
